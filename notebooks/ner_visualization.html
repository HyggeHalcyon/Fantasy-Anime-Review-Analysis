,&quot; an anime with tremendous potential, ends up suffering the same fate as a run of the mill anime.

 had something special, and that was its premise: an immortal elf grappling with the impermanence of human life after the death of her companions. However, the potential was destroyed, but how? Very slowly anime with a story lacking direction and constantly introducing unplanned events that made the viewer much more confused and forgot the purpose of the journey because not even our characters were discussing it anymore The biggest problem with this anime is its pacing; episodes feel like a race between snails and ... dedicate too much screen time to scenes that are non-essential and do not contribute anything to the story. For example, &quot;Frieren walks around the city and talks to a random character from whom she learns nothing, and that character will not even reappear. As for the story, what can I say? It largely relies on flashbacks to the adventures our elf has gone through, but initially, they are interesting, and then they become repetitive and boring. We see the same moments unfolding again and again. Some flashbacks feel like they only exist to fill up time in the episode rather than being used for something more useful (like character development). The entire series tries to drown you in emotions... Bombs of &quot;sentimental&quot; moments are thrown in without reason. I cannot understand what the author exactly wanted to do; they try to create many dramatic moments with the &quot;adventurers,&quot; but at the same time, we barely learn anything about them, and in the end, we know just as much as we did in the

 of what it promises. The pacing is sluggish, the story repetitive, and the characters underdeveloped, ruining everything and turning it into a dissatisfying series by the end of the journey. This could have helped the viewer to question life, and the weight of time, but instead, the slow pace and awkward melancholy make the viewer lose interest in such matters. I cannot recommend this anime; I struggled with it... if I did not watch it
